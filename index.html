                <p> Welcome to my personal website! My name is William Hart and I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Delaware. 
                    I completed my major with a concentration in artificial intelligence and a minor in Game Studies. 
                    My previous roles as a undergraduate researcher within UD's Software Engineering lab and as vice president of the ACM club at UD have helped me start my career in tech.
                    I am now a level 1 network storage engineer at Zerowait and I'm looking forward to growing and learning more throughout my projects! 
                </p>
                <p> My interests include web development, stable diffusion, machine learning, computer vision, running, disc golf, and exploring state/national parks. I'm planning to fine-tune
                    my skills with projects that keep me interested and actively learning.
                </p>
                <p> So, I've created this website to post these projects and explore web development. I'll be posting links to my projects on the projects page seen above! </p>
                <p> Thanks for visiting! </p>
